# Bazar-Sodai-Server

This is the server side code of Bazar-Sodai. Bazar-Sodai is a online store, where you can buy product online and also track your orders. This project also has admin panel so that new product can be added, deleted.

For this project I have used Express JS and Mongo DB in server side. Client side is made with react JS.
